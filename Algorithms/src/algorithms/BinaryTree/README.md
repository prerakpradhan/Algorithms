#Binary Search Tree:
The binary Search tree code is in Tree.java, insert is done by the method insert. 

Height of tree of the binary tree is done by method heightOfTree

Deletion of a node of a tree is done by method delete

Inorder, postorder and preorder traversal is by method inorder, postorder, preorder

##Binary Tree questions:
### 1. Sum of Paths
All nodes along children pointers from root to leaf nodes form a path in a binary tree. Given a binary tree and a number, please print out all of paths where the sum of all nodes value is same as the given number: 
#####Solution is in SumOfPaths.java
### 2. Lowest Common Ancestor:
Given a binary search tree, find the lowest common ancestor of two given nodes in the tree: 
#####Solution is in Tree.java, method LCA
### 3. Height of Tree:
Given a binary search tree, find its height
#####Solution is in Tree.java, method heightOfTree
### 4. IsBST:
Given a binary tree, check if its a binary search tree
#####Solution is in Tree.java, method isBST
### 5. BST to Doubly linked list:
Convert a binary search tree to a sorted double-linked list.
#####Solution is in BSTtoLinkedList
### 6. CheckSum:
Check if there are any two nodes with a given sum in the tree.
#####Solution is in Tree.java, method is CheckSum
### 7. PreOrder and InOrder to BT:
Given a PreOrder and an InOrder Traversal construct the Binary Tree
#####Solution is in BinaryTreefromPreandIn
### 8. Nodes with K number of Leaves
Implement a function which returns list of all nodes in a binary tree having a given number of leaves, say k .
#####Solution is in kLeaves, method is NoOfLeaves
### 9. Check if Tree is foldable
Question: Given a binary tree, find out if the tree can be folded or not. A tree can be folded if left and right subtrees of the tree are structure wise mirror image of each other. An empty tree is considered as foldable.
#####Solution in foldable trees
### 10. Maximum width of a binary Tree
Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. Width of a tree is maximum of widths of all levels
#####Solution in maxWidth
### 11. All Ancestors
Given a Binary Tree and a key, write a function that prints all the ancestors of the key in the given binary tree.
#####Solution in AllAncestors
### 12. Check if a Given Binary Tree is a sum Tree
Write a function that returns true if the given Binary Tree is SumTree else false. A SumTree is a Binary Tree where the value of a node is equal to sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree. 
#####Soln Sumtree.java method CheckBinaryTree
### 13. Check if a binary tree is subtree of another binary tree
Given two binary trees, check if the first tree is subtree of the second one. A subtree of a tree T is a tree S consisting of a node in T and all of its descendants in T. 
#####Solution in Subtree.java
### 14. Largest Independent Set Problem
Given a Binary Tree, find size of the Largest Independent Set(LIS) in it. A subset of all tree nodes is an independent set if there is no edge between any two nodes of the subset. 
##### Solution in LIS
### 15. Find the maximum path sum between two leaves of a binary tree
Given a binary tree in which each node element contains a number. Find the maximum possible sum from one leaf node to another.
##### Solution in maxLeafPath
### 16. Find the closest leaf in a Binary Tree
Given a Binary Tree and a key ‘k’, find distance of the closest leaf from ‘k’.
##### Solution in getCloseLeafDist
### 17. Find the inorder Sucessor
Given a parent pointer, find the inorder sucessor of the given Node
##### Solution in inorderSuccessor.java
### 18. iteratively inorder 
Iteratively traverse the tree in inorderFashion.
##### Solution in iterativeInorder.java
### 19. iteratively inorder without stack 
Iteratively traverse the tree in inorderFashion without a stack.
##### Solution in iterativeInorderStackLess.java
### 20. lowest common ancestor
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor of two given nodes in the tree.
##### Solution in LCA.java method getLCA.
