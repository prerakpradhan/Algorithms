#Binary Tree:
The binary tree code is in Tree.java, insert is done by the method insert. 

Height of tree of the binary tree is done by method heightOfTree

Deletion of a node of a tree is done by method delete

Inorder, postorder and preorder traversal is by method inorder, postorder, preorder

##Binary Tree questions:
### 1. Sum of Paths
All nodes along children pointers from root to leaf nodes form a path in a binary tree. Given a binary tree and a number, please print out all of paths where the sum of all nodes value is same as the given number: 
#####Solution is in SumOfPaths.java
### 2. Lowest Common Ancestor:
Given a binary search tree, find the lowest common ancestor of two given nodes in the tree: 
#####Solution is in Tree.java, method LCA
### 3. Height of Tree:
Given a binary search tree, find its height
#####Solution is in Tree.java, method heightOfTree
### 4. IsBST:
Given a binary tree, check if its a binary search tree
#####Solution is in Tree.java, method isBST
### 5. BST to Doubly linked list:
Convert a binary search tree to a sorted double-linked list.
#####Solution is in BSTtoLinkedList
