### 9. Check if Tree is foldable
Question: Given a binary tree, find out if the tree can be folded or not. A tree can be folded if left and right subtrees of the tree are structure wise mirror image of each other. An empty tree is considered as foldable.
#####Solution in foldable trees
### 10. Maximum width of a binary Tree
Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. Width of a tree is maximum of widths of all levels
#####Solution in maxWidth
### 11. All Ancestors
Given a Binary Tree and a key, write a function that prints all the ancestors of the key in the given binary tree.
#####Solution in AllAncestors
### 12. Check if a Given Binary Tree is a sum Tree
Write a function that returns true if the given Binary Tree is SumTree else false. A SumTree is a Binary Tree where the value of a node is equal to sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree. 
#####Soln Sumtree.java method CheckBinaryTree
### 13. Check if a binary tree is subtree of another binary tree
Given two binary trees, check if the first tree is subtree of the second one. A subtree of a tree T is a tree S consisting of a node in T and all of its descendants in T. 
#####Solution in Subtree.java
### 14. Largest Independent Set Problem
Given a Binary Tree, find size of the Largest Independent Set(LIS) in it. A subset of all tree nodes is an independent set if there is no edge between any two nodes of the subset. 
##### Solution in LIS
